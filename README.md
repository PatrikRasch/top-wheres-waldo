## Purpose of the Project

Practice project to further development skills in React, TypeScript and Tailwind.
The project is meant to challenge the user to find the characters as fast possible by clicking on them and selecting them. Similar to a classic game of "Where's Waldo?".

## Game Features

- Real-time character verification
- Real-time game over verification
- Secure game updates using Firebase cloud functions
- Global leaderboard without login

## Technologies

- TypeScript
- React
- Firestore
- Tailwind CSS

## Known issues

As this project is a practice project, efforts were primarily placed on ensuring the base functionality of the app.
Therefore, the end result is currently quite barebones and:

- Not mobile friendly
- Missing a more functional timer, currently only runs in pure seconds
- Works, but doesn't scale well on wide and ultrawide monitors
- Misses proper form validation for name input
- Has no censorship for names
- Overall design is lacking
