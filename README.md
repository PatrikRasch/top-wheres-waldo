## Known issues

As this project is a practice project, efforts were primarily placed on ensuring the base functionality of the app.
Therefore, the end result is currently quite barebones and:

- Not mobile friendly
- Missing a more functional timer, currently only runs in pure seconds
- Works, but doesn't scale well on wide and ultrawide monitors
- Misses proper form validation for name input
- Has no censorship for names
- Overall design is lacking
